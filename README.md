# Computer Systems Projects

As a part of UChicago's Introduction to Computer Systems class, we had to code our own cache simulator that
simulates the number of hits misses and evictions that occur in a cache of different properties, code our 
own shell that responds to command line inputs and is defensive in nature, and play with bit manipulation

Through this course andf through these projects, I've learned more about how the computer works on a low level,
and also learned how to better approach complex problems and break them down into solvable problems. I learned 
how to better think like a computer scientist, and how to code more logically.
